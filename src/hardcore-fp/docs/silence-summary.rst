summary notes for part 1
========================

most loops are...
-----------------
- reduce
- filter
- map

things to remember
------------------
- make all function inputs explicit as arguments
- these arguments can be provided over time, not just
  all at once (currying)
- try not to modify outside things (calls to console.log(), 
  modifying an existing object e.g, .push(); keep functions pure!)
- compose without 'glue' variables
